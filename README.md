o create a dashboard, we must first identify the business KPIs and then assess those values using data.
I've gone over some measurable matrices that can help a company to drive and give direction.
I computed the following quantitative matrices:
Monthly sales: Understanding seasonality and demand patterns.
Profit per client: It is critical, and we must calculate it, because it speaks to the business's goal of maximising profit for each customer. I realized that its expansion isn't all that significant.
Profit per ship mode:" Standard Class "is the most profitable mode of shipping.
Copiers are the most profitable subcategory, and the region is "South." However, the company offers the greatest discount on "Binders."
"Technical good" has earned the majority of the profit, which is increasing year after year.
The correlation between sales and profit is quite high, indicating that the organisation is doing well.
In this case, the decision tree assists in identifying the profit regionally as well as the most profitable goods name.
New York is the best place to promote technical goods because their monthly sales are promising.
There are numerous analyses that can be performed by connecting business thinking.
